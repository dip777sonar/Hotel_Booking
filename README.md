Business Problem

In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less-than-ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.


The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.

Research Question

1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can we make hotel reservation cancellations better?
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

Hypothesis

1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is a long waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.

Conclusion

After analyzing the data, I can conclude by confirming that the cancellation rates increase when the price increases. By lowering the price and also offering discounts or coupons to customers, you would prevent cancellations.
The ratio of cancellations and not cancellations is higher in the resort hotels than in the city hotels. So the hotels could provide a discount on the room prices on weekends or during holiday periods.
In the month of January, hotels could advertise and run different campaigns, as the cancellation rate is the highest in this month.
Finally, increasing the standard of their hotels and their services, mainly in Portugal can reduce the cancellation rate.
